# Firmware

Made the firmware for my hackpad using KMK. It uses the buttons for daily monotonous tasks which require more than 1 keypress, like Alt+Tab, Ctrl+C, Screenshot BUT one button opens https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ when pressed. Have a look :D

I have added text that appears on the OLED -

-  Default state- "BajajPad"
- When rotary encoder is rotated- "Volume Up" or "Volume Down"
- When special button is pressed - A Rick Astley Sprite (Took AI help to generate and integrate)

Will add more animations for other buttons
