# BajajPad
![image](/assets/no_bg.png)
A handy macropad with a rotary encoder and an OLED display. This is created for the Hack Club HackPad V3 YSWS and this is my first time doin 3D modelling and making a PCB.

### Inspiration

I looked at so many different projects which motivated me to try my hand at this.

### Challenges

I used 3D modelling and PCB software for the first time. It took a lot of time and a lot of Google searches to finally complete it. I faced a lot of problems in Fusion 360 particularly when aligning the case parts, PCB and keycaps for a test fit.
